# Python List Operations Example

This project demonstrates basic Python list operations step-by-step, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.

## Steps Performed
1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Append the values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`.
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position.
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30`.


## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `list_operations.py`.
2. Run the file with:
```bash
python list_operations.py
